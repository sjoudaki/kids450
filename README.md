# KiDS-450

We include the modified CosmoMC modules and associated data files for cosmology fitting with 450 square degrees of cosmic shear data from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS-450) in "kids450code.tar.gz".

We also include the modified CosmoMC modules and associated data above as part of a clean version of CosmoMC (July 2015 version) in "cosmomckids.tar.gz".

There is more specific information in the readme file included in the tarballs.

We note that this fitting pipeline has been included in CosmoLSS (https://github.com/sjoudaki/CosmoLSS), which is the code that we actively maintain and continue to expand.

Please feel free to contact us at shahab.joudaki@physics.ox.ac.uk if you have any questions.
